## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- You need to have a nodejs installed on your machine.
- You need to have a code editor installed on your local machine. I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Setup
- Clone the repository `git@github.com:rotshidzw/space-travelers-hub.git` to your local machine.
- Open the terminal and navigate to the root of the repository.
- Run the following command:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
